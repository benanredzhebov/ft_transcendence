What does “Remote Players” mean?
Remote players: Two (or more) users, each on different computers, can:

Access the same website (your Pong app on the browser).
Join the same Pong match together, seeing the same game state, controlling each paddle in real-time.
Handle problems like:
If one disconnects, the other is informed or the match ends gracefully.
Lag: If the network is slow, minimize bad effects (rubber banding, missed moves, etc).
In summary: You want your Pong game to be a real online multiplayer game!

How does this usually work? (“Game Rooms” model)
The most common approach is something like this:

Game lobby/rooms: When a player enters, they join a “room.” When 2 are present, a match starts. Others wait for a free slot.
Player assignment: Player on browser “A” is assigned Paddle 1, browser “B” gets Paddle 2.
Realtime communication: Player A presses “W”/“S”, their browser sends a message to the server → server updates game state → server sends new state to both A and B.
Disconnections: If someone closes browser or loses connection, server notifies the other player.
Reconnection/Timeouts: Optionally, let a player reconnect, or after a timeout, declare winner/close room.
Where does this logic go in your code?
Frontend: Handle “joining a room”, display “waiting for opponent”, assign controls per player slot, and display disconnect messages.
Backend (server.js, GameEngine.js): Manage rooms, track which socket is "player 1" and which is "player 2" for each match, dispatch state updates to only the correct sockets, and handle disconnect logic.
High-level Implementation Plan
Room Management (Backend):

When someone connects, check if there’s a room with only one person – add them as player 2 and start the match.
Otherwise, create a new room, add them as player 1, and wait for an opponent.
Each GameEngine is linked to a room.
Track mapping: roomId → {player1Socket, player2Socket, engine}
Player Controls:

When a socket sends a move event, it must specify its room and player slot.
Server checks that socket is allowed to control that paddle.
Frontend:

On connect: "Joining game...", then "Waiting for opponent..." if alone, or game starts if paired.
Keypresses only send events for your player.
If you disconnect, the other player is notified.
Disconnection Handling:

If a player disconnects, notify the other and clean up the room.
Practical Example
Backend (pseudo-code for socket.io)
See Socket.IO rooms documentation and tutorials like “How To Make a Multiplayer Pong Game” (see also YouTube: Socket.IO pong tutorial).

Basic backend flow:

JavaScript

Collapse
const rooms = {}; // roomId -> {player1, player2, engine}

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  let joinedRoom = null;
  // Find a room with only 1 player, else create new
  for (const roomId in rooms) {
    const room = rooms[roomId];
    if (!room.player2) {
      room.player2 = socket;
      joinedRoom = roomId;
      socket.emit('game_start', { roomId, player: 2 });
      room.player1.emit('game_start', { roomId, player: 1 });
      break;
    }
  }
  if (!joinedRoom) {
    // Create new
    const roomId = generateRoomId();
    rooms[roomId] = { player1: socket, engine: new GameEngine() };
    socket.emit('waiting_for_player', { roomId, player: 1 });
    joinedRoom = roomId;
  }
  socket.join(joinedRoom);

  // Handle player input
  socket.on('player_move', ({ direction }) => {
    // Only let correct player move the correct paddle!
    // ...
    rooms[joinedRoom].engine.handlePlayerInput(/*player slot*/, direction);
  });

  // On disconnect
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    const room = rooms[joinedRoom];
    if (room) {
      // Notify opponent, cleanup, etc.
    }
  });
});

// Game loop per room
setInterval(() => {
  for (const roomId in rooms) {
    const { player1, player2, engine } = rooms[roomId];
    engine.update(1/60);
    // Emit only to players in that room:
    if (player1) player1.emit('state_update', engine.getState());
    if (player2) player2.emit('state_update', engine.getState());
  }
}, 1000/60);
Frontend
When page loads, connect.
Wait for game_start or waiting_for_player; show appropriate UI.
Only send paddle movement for your player id.

Best User Experience Tips
Show "waiting for opponent..." and "opponent disconnected, you win/lost/return to menu" messages.
Prevent control if you’re not assigned to a paddle yet.
Optionally: ping-pong messages for latency calculation, or interpolate if you want advanced smoothness (but for Pong, basic state sync is enough).
If a player leaves, allow to re-join the queue or start a new match easily.
Summary
Implement game rooms and player assignment on the server with socket.io.
Make the frontend only send controls for the currently assigned paddle.
Handle waiting, game start, and disconnect gracefully.
