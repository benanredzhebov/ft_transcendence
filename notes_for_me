Benan Notes. Should to fix :

1. While registering the aliases, if the window is changed, the bracket disappears. `FIXED`
  - assignned new variable to track if the alias is registered `aliasRegistered = false`. added it to 'alias_registered'
  - adjusted the event listener for the visibility change
  - also re-promt on socket reconnect if not registered

2. After stopping the server and rerunning it, pressing "Back" in the game window does not make the result disappear. `FIXED`
  - frontend socket.on -> disconnect part

3. After the tournament ends, pressing the "Return to Lobby" button does not display the results. `FIXED`
  - Save tournament results in the state_update
  - reset tournamentResults[] at the start of each new tournament(in the tournament_lobby handler) to avoid mixing results from previous tournaments.
  - When the tournament ends I  press Return to Lobby, your showTournamentResults function is called.

4. Should develop Tournament bracket to see all matches result


5. After the 1st match if 1 player press I'm ready button the countdown starts. Should wait to all players to press the button I'm ready

6. After the tournament has finsished -> Return to Lobby button -> Back to Dashboard button -> appears Disconnected for a while
