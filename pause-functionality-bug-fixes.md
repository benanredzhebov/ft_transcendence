# Pause Functionality Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Lost Paddle Controls After Resume

**Problem**: After pausing and resuming the game, players lost control of their paddles.

**Root Cause**: When the game was resumed, the key event handlers were still active, but the game state wasn't properly restored, and any keys pressed during pause remained "stuck" in the pressed state.

**Solution**:

1. **Added resume callback system** in `PauseManager`:

   - Added `onResumeCallback` property to handle post-resume actions
   - Added `setOnResumeCallback()` method to set the callback
   - Updated all resume handlers (`game_resumed`, `tournament_resumed`, `local_tournament_resumed`) to call the callback

2. **Enhanced canvas focus management**:

   - Added `tabIndex = 0` to the canvas to make it properly focusable
   - Resume callback now focuses the canvas after resume
   - Clear `pressedKeys` set to remove any stuck key states from before pause

3. **Game controls restoration**:
   - Resume callback clears any pressed keys that might be stuck
   - Ensures canvas has focus to receive keyboard events
   - Added debugging log to confirm controls are restored

### Issue 2: Back to Dashboard Goes to Login Page

**Problem**: When clicking "Back to Dashboard" during pause, the user was redirected to the login page instead of the dashboard.

**Root Cause**: The pause manager was navigating to `/` (welcome page) instead of `/dashboard`, and the welcome page likely redirects to login when no authentication is found.

**Solution**:

1. **Added proper authentication check** in `PauseManager`:

   - Created `navigateToDashboard()` method that checks for both `sessionStorage.authToken` and `localStorage.jwtToken`
   - If authenticated, navigates to `/dashboard`
   - If not authenticated, navigates to `/login`

2. **Updated dashboard button handler**:
   - Now uses the proper `navigateToDashboard()` method instead of hardcoded navigation to `/`

## Technical Implementation

### PauseManager.ts Changes

```typescript
// Added callback system
private onResumeCallback: (() => void) | null = null;

setOnResumeCallback(callback: (() => void) | null) {
    this.onResumeCallback = callback;
}

// Enhanced resume handlers
this.socket.on('game_resumed', () => {
    this.state.gamePaused = false;
    this.hidePauseOverlay();
    // Call the resume callback to restore game controls
    if (this.onResumeCallback) {
        this.onResumeCallback();
    }
});

// Proper dashboard navigation
private navigateToDashboard() {
    const token = sessionStorage.getItem('authToken');
    const jwtToken = localStorage.getItem('jwtToken');

    if (token || jwtToken) {
        window.location.href = '/dashboard';
    } else {
        window.location.href = '/login';
    }
}
```

### Game.ts Changes

```typescript
// Made canvas focusable
canvas.tabIndex = 0;

// Set up resume callback to restore controls
pauseManager.setOnResumeCallback(() => {
  // Clear any stuck keys from before pause
  pressedKeys.clear();

  // Ensure game canvas has focus
  if (canvas) {
    canvas.focus();
  }

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Game controls restored after resume");
  }, 50);
});
```

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Frontend build successful
- ✅ Backend server running on correct port (8443)
- ✅ All pause functionality preserved
- ✅ Controls restoration implemented
- ✅ Proper dashboard navigation implemented

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test paddle controls after resume**:

   - Start any game mode
   - Pause the game
   - Resume the game
   - Verify paddles respond to keyboard input

2. **Test dashboard navigation**:
   - Start any game mode
   - Pause the game
   - Click "Back to Dashboard"
   - Verify you go to the dashboard (not login page) if authenticated

Both issues should now be resolved!

## UPDATE: Final Fix for Paddle Movement

**Additional Root Cause Found**: The main issue was that the `movePlayers()` animation loop was using early return statements when paused, which prevented the `requestAnimationFrame(movePlayers)` from being called, permanently breaking the animation loop.

**Final Fix Applied**:

```typescript
// Fixed movePlayers() to always maintain the animation loop
function movePlayers() {
  // Only process movement if game is active and not paused
  if (
    socket &&
    !gameEnded &&
    !pauseManager.getState().gamePaused &&
    (!inTournament || matchStarted)
  ) {
    // ... movement input processing ...
  }
  // Always continue the animation loop, even when paused
  movePlayersFrame = requestAnimationFrame(movePlayers);
}
```

This ensures the animation loop never stops, but movement input is only processed when the game is not paused. **Paddle controls should now work perfectly after resume!**
