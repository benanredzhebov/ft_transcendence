# Tournament Reset During Active Match - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

When the server restarts during an active tournament match:

1. Frontend shows "connection lost" message with reconnect button
2. Server restart clears all tournament state
3. Reconnect button only reloads the page without proper state handling
4. Players lose tournament context and see inconsistent states

## Root Issues Fixed

### 1. **No Automatic Reconnection**

**Before:** Socket.IO connection had no automatic reconnection configured
**After:** Added comprehensive reconnection configuration:

```javascript
socket = io("https://127.0.0.1:3000", {
  reconnection: true,
  reconnectionAttempts: 5,
  reconnectionDelay: 1000,
  reconnectionDelayMax: 5000,
  timeout: 20000,
  // ... other options
});
```

### 2. **Poor Disconnect/Reconnect UX**

**Before:** Simple "Disconnected" message with basic reconnect button
**After:** Enhanced disconnect handling with:

- Different messages based on disconnect reason
- Real-time reconnection status updates
- Automatic reconnection attempts with progress display
- Manual reconnect fallback option

### 3. **No Server Restart Detection**

**Before:** Server restart was silent, leaving clients in inconsistent state
**After:** Added server-side detection and notification:

```javascript
// Server detects clients connecting after restart
if (gameMode === "tournament" && !tournament) {
  socket.emit("tournament_reset", {
    reason:
      "Server was restarted during tournament. All tournament states have been cleared.",
  });
}
```

### 4. **Missing Tournament State Recovery**

**Before:** Page reload lost all tournament context
**After:** Added tournament state preservation:

- Store tournament reconnection state in sessionStorage
- Restore tournament context after reconnection
- Handle alias registration state properly

### 5. **No Administrative Reset Capability**

**Before:** No way to manually reset stuck tournaments
**After:** Added admin reset functionality:

```javascript
socket.on("admin_reset_tournament", ({ token }) => {
  // Verify authentication
  // Cancel countdowns
  // Notify all clients
  // Reset tournament and game state
});
```

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`server.js`)

1. **Server Initialization Cleanup:**

   - Added `initializeServer()` function to reset states on startup
   - Clear any existing tournament and game states

2. **Connection Handler Enhancement:**

   - Detect tournament mode clients connecting after server restart
   - Emit `tournament_reset` event to inform clients

3. **Admin Reset Handler:**
   - Added `admin_reset_tournament` event handler
   - Properly cancel countdowns and notify all clients
   - Clean reset of tournament and game states

### Frontend Changes (`game.ts`)

1. **Socket Configuration:**

   - Added automatic reconnection settings
   - Configured reconnection attempts and delays

2. **Enhanced Disconnect Handling:**

   - Different messages based on disconnect reason
   - Real-time reconnection status updates
   - Store/restore tournament state in sessionStorage

3. **Tournament Reset Handlers:**

   - Added `tournament_reset` event handler
   - Clear tournament state and redirect to dashboard
   - Handle server restart scenarios gracefully

4. **Reconnection Logic:**
   - Detect tournament reconnection scenarios
   - Restore alias registration state
   - Clear reconnection flags after handling

### Dashboard Changes (`dashboard.ts`)

1. **Chat Socket Reconnection:**
   - Added same reconnection configuration to chat socket
   - Ensure consistent behavior across both sockets

## Testing Scenarios Covered

### 1. **Server Restart During Tournament Registration**

- **Setup:** Players registered in tournament lobby
- **Action:** Restart backend server
- **Expected:** Players see "Tournament reset due to server restart" message
- **Result:** Clean redirect to dashboard, can start new tournament

### 2. **Server Restart During Active Match**

- **Setup:** Tournament match in progress
- **Action:** Restart backend server (Ctrl+C, npm run dev)
- **Expected:** Players see tournament reset message, match is cancelled
- **Result:** Clean state reset, no orphaned matches

### 3. **Network Disconnection**

- **Setup:** Tournament in progress
- **Action:** Simulate network disconnect
- **Expected:** Auto-reconnection attempts, status updates
- **Result:** Graceful reconnection with state preservation

### 4. **Manual Tournament Reset**

- **Setup:** Tournament stuck or admin needs to reset
- **Action:** Use admin reset function
- **Expected:** All players notified, clean reset
- **Result:** Tournament state cleared, players can start fresh

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Dual Socket Architecture:**

   - Game socket and chat socket both handle reconnection
   - Consistent behavior across both connections

2. **Session Management:**

   - Authentication token validation before redirects
   - Proper session expiration handling

3. **State Synchronization:**

   - Tournament alias registration state preserved
   - Game assignment states cleared appropriately

4. **User Experience:**
   - Clear, informative messages for all scenarios
   - No unexpected behaviors or hangs
   - Proper cleanup of UI elements

## Testing Utilities Created

Created `tournament-admin-test.js` with testing utilities:

- Manual tournament reset triggers
- Connection simulation tools
- State inspection helpers

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. **Start tournament with multiple players**
2. **Begin a match**
3. **Restart backend server** (Ctrl+C, npm run dev)
4. **Observe frontend behavior:**
   - Shows "Tournament reset due to server restart" message
   - Provides "Return to Dashboard" button
   - Clears all tournament state on return
   - No orphaned matches or stuck states

## Notes for Future

- Admin reset functionality can be extended with proper role-based access control
- Could add tournament state persistence to database for recovery after restarts
- Reconnection logic could be enhanced with exponential backoff for better performance
- Consider adding tournament pause/resume functionality for planned maintenance
